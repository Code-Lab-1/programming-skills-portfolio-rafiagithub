## Exercise 1: Pizza Toppings :ballot_box_with_check:

print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.

## Exercise 2: Movie Tickets: :ballot_box_with_check:

A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their 

age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

## Exercise 4: Deli :ballot_box_with_check:

Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches.

Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, 

move it to the list of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.

## Exercise 5: No Pastrami :ballot_box_with_check:

Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code

near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all 

occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.
